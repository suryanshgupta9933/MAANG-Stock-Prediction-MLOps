## Workflow of ML based Software Development
- Three main artifacts in ML-based software: Data, Model, and Code.
- Three main phases: Data Engineering, ML Model Engineering, and Code Engineering.

### Data Engineering
- Data Engineering is the process of collecting, cleaning, and transforming data into a usable format for building ML models.
- Data Engineering is the most time-consuming part of the ML workflow.


#### Data Engineering Pipeline
1. **Data Ingestion**: Collecting data from various sources.
2. **Data Validation**: Validating the data to ensure that it is in the correct format.
3. **Data Transformation**: Transforming the data into a usable format for ML models.
4. **Data Splitting**: Splitting the data into training, validation, and testing sets.
5. **Data Versioning**: Versioning the data to keep track of changes.
6. **Data Analysis**: Analyzing the data to gain insights.

### ML Model Engineering
- ML Model Engineering is the process of building ML models.
- Objective of ML Model Engineering is to build a model that can make accurate predictions on unseen data.

#### ML Model Engineering Pipeline
1. **Feature Engineering**: Extracting features from the data.
2. **Model Training**: Training the model on the training data.
3. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating the model on the validation data.
4. **Model Selection**: Selecting the best model based on the evaluation metrics.
5. **Model Versioning**: Versioning the model to keep track of changes.
6. **Model Packaging**: Packaging the model to make it usable in production.

### Code Engineering
- Code Engineering is the process of building a production-ready codebase for the ML model.
- Code Engineering is the most overlooked part of the ML workflow.

#### Code Engineering Pipeline
1. **Code Packaging**: Packaging the code to make it usable in production.
2. **Code Testing**: Testing the code to ensure that it works as expected.
3. **Code Deployment**: Deploying the code to a production environment.
4. **Code Monitoring**: Monitoring the code to ensure that it works as expected.
